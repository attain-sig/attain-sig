    <description>Membership includes the Primary Contact and this Secondary Contact when they construct address blocks and letter salutations for mass mailings. They don't include any of the other Contacts in the Account. On households where the Auto fields are unchecked in the Manage Household screen, those manually entered Formal Greeting and Informal Greeting values will override Membership's use of Primary Contact and Secondary Contact.</description>
