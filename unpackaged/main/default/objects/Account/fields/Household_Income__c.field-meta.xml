    <description>JS 2/9/2023: Research, do you use this field? If not, it may be old Membership data.
Camille 2/9: Not a Research field. Not on our layout. Up to Membership.
Camille 4/24: Reconfirming that this is not a Research field and not a field on Development's layout
JS 5/8/2023: OK let's DEPRECATE! Membership is buying this data for segmentation but we keep it in Snowflake -- it's not worth loading to Salesforce just for our use.</description>
