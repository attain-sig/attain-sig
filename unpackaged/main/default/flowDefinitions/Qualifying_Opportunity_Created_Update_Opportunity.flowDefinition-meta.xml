    <description>Created as a part of 2023 R4 enhancements (US-740). This flow triggers when a Qualifying Opportunity is created and updates the values of the &quot;Annual Match Originating Donation&quot; and &quot;Stage&quot; fields on the record itself. It also ensures that the &quot;Challenge Match Qualifying Donation&quot; field is checked off as TRUE on the referenced Opportunity.</description>
