    <subject>Climate Corps: Application Status</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {{{Fellow_Application__c.Applicant_First_Name__c}}},

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us to discuss your interests and qualifications for the Climate Corps program. Our fellow-matching team has interviewed many highly competitive and qualified applicants, making it especially difficult to narrow the applicant pool. 

I am writing to inform you that your application is no longer under consideration for a position with Climate Corps for the 2024 India cohort. Due to the high volume of candidates, we are unable to provide further feedback on your individual application. 

You remain a valuable member of the sustainability community and we wish you great success in making the world a more energy-efficient and environmentally conscious place. We hope you will stay in touch with the EDF community &lt; https://business.edf.org/get-involved-with-edf/ &gt; . 

We appreciate your interest in the Climate Corps program and thank you for your time and consideration of this position.

Best regards, 

The Climate Corps Team
