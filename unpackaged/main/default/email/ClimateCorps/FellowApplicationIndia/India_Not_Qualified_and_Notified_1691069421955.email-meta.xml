    <textOnly>Dear {{{Fellow_Application__c.Applicant_First_Name__c}}},

Thank you for your interest in the Climate Corps program. I am writing to inform you that your application is no longer under consideration for a position with Climate Corps for the 2023 cohort.

You were among many highly qualified Climate Corps applicants in 2023. Matching candidates with organizations is a unique process of identifying and meeting the precise needs of our hosts. Typically, only very few candidates are an exact fit for each of our host organizations.

Due to the high volume of candidates, we are unable to provide further feedback on your individual application. 

You remain a valuable member of the sustainability community and we wish you great success in making the world a more energy-efficient and environmentally conscious place. We hope you will stay in touch with the EDF community &lt; https://business.edf.org/get-involved-with-edf/ &gt; .

We appreciate your interest in the Climate Corps program and thank you for your time and consideration of this position.

Best regards, 

The Climate Corps Team
