<br />
<span style="background:white"><span style="color:#181818">I hope you're well! Thanks again for your partnership in hosting this past summer. I'm reaching out to see if you and your team might be interested in hosting a Climate Corps fellow again in 2024. Since you're familiar with the program and process, I'll keep this short; The main change to the program this year is that we've increased the minimum fellow pay to $1,400/week to keep up with inflation and the market. This means that including payment for the week of Training, host companies should budget at least $15,400 for a 10-week fellowship. As always, we consider this number a minimum and encourage companies to pay fellows commensurate with their peers if that amount is higher. </span></span><br />

<span style="background:white"><span style="color:#181818">We are encouraging a June 5th, 2024 start date for the fellow if possible (the week of Training is the preceding week), but are flexible as in the past. Would it be helpful to hop on a call in the next couple weeks to discuss project ideas and go over any questions you might have? If yes, let me know when is best for you and I'll send over an invite. Or, if easier, here's my </span></span><a href="https://google.com" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"><span style="background:white"><span style="color:#181818">Calendly</span></span></a><span style="background:white"><span style="color:#181818">. </span></span><br />
