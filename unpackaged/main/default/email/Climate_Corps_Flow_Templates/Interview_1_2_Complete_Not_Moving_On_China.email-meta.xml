    <subject>Climate Corps: Application Status</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Fellow_Application__c.Applicant_First_Name__c},


Thank you for taking the time to meet with us to discuss your interests and qualifications for the Climate Corps program.â€¯Our fellow-matching team has interviewed many highly competitive and qualified applicants, making it especially difficult to narrow the applicant pool.



I am writing to inform you that your application is no longer under consideration for a position with Climate Corps for the 2023 China cohort. Due to the high volume of candidates, we are unable to provide further feedback on your individual application. If you have questions about developing your application for opportunities beyond Climate Corps, we recommend visiting your university career services office.



You remain a valuable member of the sustainability community and we wish you great success in making the world a more energy-efficient and environmentally conscious place. We hope you will stay in touch with the EDF community.



We appreciate your interest in the Climate Corps program and thank you for your time and consideration of this position.



Sincerely,

The Climate Corps Team</textOnly>
