    <textOnly>Dear {!Fellow_Application__c.Applicant_First_Name__c},



Thank you for taking the time to meet with us to discuss your interests and qualifications for the Climate Corps China Fellowship program. Our fellow-matching team has interviewed many highly competitive and qualified applicants making it especially difficult to narrow the applicant pool, as we have limited host placements.



We have decided to waitlist your application. However, because you meet our fellowship qualifications, your application is still under consideration. While we cannot guarantee you will be invited for a second interview, we remain optimistic about our ability to advance waitlist candidates as we have done so during previous application cycles. At the latest, we will contact you by early March 2023.




We realize you may have questions as to the reason behind our decision, but due to the high volume of applications, we are unable to provide you with detailed feedback. We will contact you within a few weeks with an update on your application status. Should you have competing job offer deadlines, please notify us by contacting climatecorps@cet.net.cn.



Best regards,

The Climate Corps Team
