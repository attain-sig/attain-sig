    <textOnly>Friends,

Earlier this month, TIME released its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. As I read it, I was struck by how prevalent climate change was throughout. The list includes people who are household names within the circles of climate philanthropy and activism — folks like Yvon Chouinard, Laurene Powell Jobs, Johan Rockström, and artists and activists of all different stripes, including the YouTube sensation Jimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, who has leveraged his online platform to plant millions of trees and remove millions of plastic bottles from our oceans.

And, while it’s no surprise to see world leaders make the list, I was struck by how many were included predominantly or in part for their commitment to or accomplishments on climate. This includes President Joe Biden, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the soon-to-be-coronated King Charles of England.

Last Friday, President Biden followed through on his commitment to update President Clinton’s historic executive order on environmental justice. It reminded me of one reason why the TIME 100 list has become so significant to me. Three years ago, Dr. Cecilia Martinez, a dear friend of mine, made the list for her pioneering work to advance environmental justice. Her inclusion represented an important moment; environmental justice advocates who had spent years feeling ignored and marginalized finally captured national attention, and the connection between racial equity and environmental impact began to receive the attention and funding that was long overdue. The list serves as a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of our movement to bring climate to the global stage.

Best,
David

Issue Updates

President Biden Signs Executive Order to Advance Environmental Justice. Last week, President Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to work toward &quot;environmental justice for all&quot; and improve the lives of communities hit hardest by toxic pollution and climate change. The order also established a new Office of Environmental Justice at the White House to coordinate the administration’s efforts to implement the new directives. EDF Trustee Peggy Shepard, Co-Chair of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council and Co-Founder and Executive Director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, was present at the signing and called it “an important action as we begin to see real investment in frontline communities.” EDF Senior Vice President of Justice and Equity Margot Brown acknowledged it as a “step forward to bring a whole-of-government approach to supporting the communities impacted by historic injustices and emerging climate threats.” Read Margot’s full statement HERE.

Speaker McCarthy Continues Pushing Debt-Limit Proposal that “Would Gut Biden’s Climate Law.” Last week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy worked to pass a proposal that would raise the federal debt limit while repealing green energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). If enacted, the proposal would hurt millions of American workers and communities and imperil the 9 million jobs that the clean energy plan is projected to create.

What you can do: Sign the EDF Action petition to urge Congress to act responsibly and protect historic investments in climate and clean energy solutions.

International Energy Agency Releases Flagship Report Global EV Outlook 2023. This week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its Global EV Outlook, an annual publication that explores recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. This year’s findings show that demand for electric cars is booming, with sales expected to leap 35% this year after a record-breaking 2022. Read more about the “sea change” in the global auto industry here.

Environmental Protection Agency Unveils Proposed Implementation Framework for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled its proposed implementation framework for the historic Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The fund, which was established under the IRA, will host national competitive grant programs that will provide $27 billion for clean energy projects — through partnerships with private sector companies and non-profit lenders, as well as through funding specifically for solar development in low-income and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Read more HERE.

EPA Releases Proposed Rule to Address Toxic Chemical Methylene Chloride Under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Methylene chloride, also known as dichloromethane, is an industrial solvent that is commonly used in paint and coating removers, as well as in many everyday products like automotive cleaners, adhesives, and degreasers. The chemical can cause severe health effects. Short-term exposures can result in harm to the central nervous system — and even death. Longer-term exposure can lead to liver toxicity, liver cancer, and lung cancer. The EPA proposed rule would ban all consumer uses of methylene chloride and most commercial uses under the jurisdiction of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The proposal includes a ban on commercial methylene chloride paint strippers — a use that has caused dozens of worker deaths. Read more HERE.

EVENT HIGHLIGHT: Tomorrow, April 28th, EDF Action will host a virtual discussion with industry leaders on the benefits of the IRA and the Future of Climate Innovation and Progress. This national membership event will feature interviews with leaders from Clean Fuels Michigan, 1 Sun Solar, North Carolina Business Council, and Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. RSVP here.
