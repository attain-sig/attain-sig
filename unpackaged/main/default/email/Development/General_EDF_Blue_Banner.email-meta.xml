    <subject>The New Yorker profile of MethaneSAT just published</subject>
    <textOnly>I am pleased to share this New Yorker article posted online a short time ago: A Security Camera for the Planet. It is the story of how an audacious idea became a reality.

It reminds me of how far weâ€™ve come in the decade since EDF recognized that reducing methane pollution was an overlooked but powerful way to make climate progress. In weeks, data will start flowing from MethaneAIR, our aircraft-based version of MethaneSAT, flying over North America. And in less than a year, MethaneSAT will deliver data to motivate action to reduce methane pollution globally. The New Yorker profile appears just as Europe moves closer to its first standards to reduce methane.

I&apos;m proud of my colleagues at EDF and at our MethaneSAT LLC as well as our many partners. Thank you for your trust and support in making this bold and critical mission possible.

Best,

Fred
